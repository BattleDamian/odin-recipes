    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sure, cookies are great, but who doesn't love cookie dough? There's something about sneaking bites from the mixing bowl that makes it even more delicious. Unfortunately, regular cookie dough isn't the safest to eat raw. That's where edible cookie dough comes in.</p>
    <p>This edible peanut butter cookie dough recipe uses heat-treated flour and no eggs, making it completely safe to eat. Heat treating flour is quick and easy and can be done ahead of time. Either microwave the flour in 30-second increments or bake it until an instant-read thermometer reads 165 F. Let the flour cool and use it to make this tempting edible cookie dough. After treating the flour there's no cooking involved, making it a great recipe for kids.</p>
    <p>Creamy peanut butter adds lots of peanut butter flavor while keeping the edible cookie dough smooth. If you'd like some texture, you can use crunchy peanut butterâ€”you may need to add more milk or cream to help the dough come together. Serve as-is or add your favorite mix-ins, like M&Ms, chocolate chips, peanut butter chips, or chopped peanuts.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup creamy peanut butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup packed brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 to 3 tablespoons milk or heavy cream</li>
        <li>Up to 1 cup mix-ins like chocolate chips, optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Heat treat the flour by adding it to a small heatproof bowl and microwaving for 30-second increments, stirring each time, until it registers 165 F on an instant-read thermometer. (Alternatively, spread the flour out on a small rimmed baking sheet and bake at 350 F for 10 minutes.)</li>
        <li>Let the flour cool to room temperature. If the flour is clumpy, whisk or sift it before using. Note: heat treating the flour can be done ahead of time.</li>
        <li>Add the softened butter and peanut butter to a medium mixing bowl. Beat with an electric mixer at medium speed for 1 minute, or until smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the brown sugar and salt. Beat at medium speed to combine then increase speed to medium-high and continue to beat for 3 minutes to help the sugar dissolve. The mixture should be smooth and creamy.</li>
        <li>Add the vanilla and mix to combine. Add the flour and mix until combined.</li>
        <li>Add 1 tablespoon of milk or heavy cream and mix to combine. Continue to add 1 tablespoon more at a time to reach your desired consistency.</li>
        <li>If adding mix-ins, stir them in with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula. Serve or store in the fridge.</li>
    </ol>
