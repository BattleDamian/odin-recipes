    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Katsudon is a popular Japanese dish consisting of tonkatsu (breaded deep-fried pork) and eggs cooked in a sweet and salty broth served over rice. Katsu, or "cutlet" in Japanese, refers to meat that's been pounded thin before being cooked. Don, or donburi, identifies this as a bowl dish. Katsudon is hearty compared to other donburi, but the taste is so good that you will not mind the extra calories from deep-frying the tonkatsu.</p>
    <p>In Japanese culture, katsudon is considered soul foodâ€”the symbol of a tasty warm meal that can melt even the coldest part of your heart. Katsudon is a typical lunch dish in Japan, and it is available at many casual restaurants, such as udon noodle shops, small corner restaurants, and bento shops. For those of us outside of Japan, here's a simple recipe to make this satisfying dish at home.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 center-cut boneless pork chops, pounded down to 1 centimeter thick</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
        <li>All-purpose flour, for dusting</li>
        <li>5 large eggs, beaten, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup panko</li>
        <li>Oil, for frying</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cups dashi soup stock</li>
        <li>1/3 cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons mirin</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>1 medium onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>4 cups Japanese steamed rice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Season the pounded pork chops with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Dust with a light, even coating of flour.</li>
        <li>In one shallow bowl, beat 1 of the eggs. Put the panko into another shallow bowl.</li>
        <li>Add a thin, even layer of oil to a cast-iron pan or skillet over medium heat. The oil is ready when you drop a panko breadcrumb into it and it sizzles.</li>
        <li>Dip the flour-dusted pork into the egg to coat both sides.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pork to the panko and press it evenly into the meat to get a good coating.</li>
        <li>Carefully lay the pork chops in the hot oil and cook for 5 to 6 minutes on one side, until golden brown.</li>
        <li>Flip and cook the other side for another 5 to 6 minutes, or until browned, crispy, and cooked through.</li>
        <li>Drain on a plate lined with a paper towel.</li>
        <li>Slice your tonkatsu into pieces.</li>
        <li>Put the dashi soup stock in a pan and heat on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to the soup and bring to a boil. Remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>To cook 1 serving of katsudon, put 1/4 of the soup and 1/4 of the sliced onion in a small skillet. Simmer for a few minutes on medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add 1 serving of tonkatsu pieces (half of 1 pork cutlet) to the pan and simmer on low heat for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Beat another one of the eggs in a bowl. Bring the soup to a boil and pour the egg over the tonkatsu and onion.</li>
        <li>Turn the heat down to low and cover with a lid. Cook until the egg has set and remove it from the heat. The egg should be cooked through.</li>
        <li>Serve by placing 1 serving of steamed rice in a large rice bowl. Top with the simmered tonkatsu on top of the rice. Repeat to make 3 more servings.</li>
    </ol>
