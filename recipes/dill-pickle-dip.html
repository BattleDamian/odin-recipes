    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Dill pickles are uniquely craveable. There's the crunch (there'd better be a crunch), the tang of vinegar that gets you right behind the jaw, the delicious funk of garlic, and the unmistakableâ€¦well, dill-ness of the dill.</p>
    <p>My great-grandmother was an incredible cook, and our whole family gathered around her table every Sunday for decades. She served a rotating cast of dishes, but there were a few constants, including a jar of her signature dills. These dills were bracingly vinegary and used almost too much dill. Almost. I would think that to myself as I ate them, one after another.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (245 grams) sour cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (100 grams) mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely diced dill pickles, more to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh dill, or to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon plus 2 teaspoons Trader Joe's In A Pickle Seasoning Blend (or make your own, see below)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon dill pickle brine</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar</li>
        <li>Potato chips, for serving</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
        <li>Mix together sour cream, mayonnaise, dill pickles, fresh dill, dill pickle seasoning, pickle brine, and vinegar in a medium bowl until combined. Taste for seasoning and add a little more dill, pickle seasoning, vinegar, or diced pickles as desired.</li>
        <li>Serve with potato chips or let the dip sit for up to 1 day before serving.</li>
    </ol>
